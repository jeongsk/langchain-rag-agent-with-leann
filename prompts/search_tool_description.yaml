  Search the LangChain and LangGraph documentation for relevant information using semantic similarity.

  This tool searches through the official LangChain and LangGraph documentation to find
  the most relevant passages that match the semantic meaning of your query. Use this when
  you need information about:
  - LangChain framework usage, APIs, and patterns
  - LangGraph architecture, state management, and agent workflows
  - Code examples and best practices from official docs
  - Troubleshooting common issues

  IMPORTANT: Query must be in English only, even if the user's question is in another language.
  If the user asks in Korean or another language, translate the key concepts to English first.

    type: string
    required: true

      that captures what information you're looking for.

      - "how to create a LangGraph supervisor agent"
      - "LangChain tool calling with OpenAI"
      - "StateGraph concurrent updates"

usage_tips:
  - "Use specific, descriptive queries rather than single keywords"
  - "For better results, formulate queries as questions or clear search phrases"
  - "If initial results aren't relevant, try rephrasing the query with different terms"
  - "Adjust top_k based on how comprehensive you need the results to be"
  - "When searching for specific APIs or classes, include the exact name in the query"
